It currently has two categories of users; casual riders (pay-as-you-go) and annual members (yearly subscribers). This case study seeks to understand how casual riders and annual members use the bikes differently using the company's data over a 12 months period (Mar. 2021 - Apr. 2022). Based on the insights gained, recommendations will be made on new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
